## Dataset Introduction




**1. Generating the dataset**
Our example dataset is simulated data due to copyright issues. If you want to use the sample data for testing, follow these steps:
Find create_data.jl in MDES/benchmark/ and run it, this process will take a while.
```
include("create_data.jl")
```
Make sure that there is a date folder in the MDES/benchmark/ directory where the data will be placed.
